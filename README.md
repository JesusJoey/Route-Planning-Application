# Route-Planning-Application
This project aims at producing a real-time navigation system which could generate the shortest path for vehicles by setting up a starting point and a destination to implement the Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. By loading the location(longitude, latitude) of a starting point and destination, this program will first find the closest street to the destination if the location is not on the main street, and then transfer them into geographic position and generate the desired path between them. It will also give the total distance of the shortest path and the exact route of how to move to the destination.
